# DAND_Analyze_ab_test_results


### I have analyzed dataset for e-commerce website by using A/B test to predict if they should update their website to new version or if they should keep it as it is

### The dataset is provided by udacity, because the goal of this project is to test our statistic understanding and how can we predict the results based on statistical operations using python.
